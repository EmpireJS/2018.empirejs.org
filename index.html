        <p>EmpireJS is committed to creating a conference that is as inclusive as possible. Diversity of voices is important to our community, and we are serious when we say <strong>everyone and anyone</strong>. If you've never given a talk before that's <strong>even more</strong> reason to submit a proposal here now. If you have any questions about what we're looking for, or you're just needing a little encouragement for your submission, please drop us an email at <a href="mailto:speakers@empirejs.org">speakers@empirejs.org</a></p>
        <p>We are also committed to ensuring the conference is a place where ideas are exchanged, old friends get together, new friends meet and harassment is not tolerated. We expect speakers, attendees, organizers, and sponsor representatives to be professional and courteous to each other. We reserve the right to remove, without refund, ANY attendee (speaker or otherwise) who is unable to adhere to this policy. Please see our <a href="#coc">Code of Conduct</a> for further details.</p>

        <h3>FAQ!</h3>
        <h4>What dates should I mark off in my calendar for the conference?</h4>
        <p>September 19 and depart September 22. We will cover these check-in and check-out as part of your speaker package.</p>

        <h4>What is the conference environment like?</h4>
        <p>Our <a href="#coc">Code of Conduct</a> and reporting is prioritized as central to creating a conference we want to be a part of and be proud to attend. We are always looking for ways to improve this. We have a legacy of trying to learn and be a more inclusive conference every year. Repeated, delightful, meaningful interactions with folks you can learn from is our aim! Stories of how we build up our skills in programming and as a great colleague/collaborator are what we love to hear most.</p>

        <h4>What types of talks are you looking for?</h4>
        <p>We look for great stories that are relevant and groundbreaking to a growing, inclusive tech ecosystem. EmpireJS has remained a single-track conference to highlight great storytellers without any distractions.</p>

        <h4>How can I increase the odds of my proposal being selected?</h4>
        <p>Speak from the heart. Ideas you know well from deep experiences, whether emotional, technical, experiential–they make the best stories. We want our attendees to walk away from the event learning something from every talk. Make sure you prioritize this for yourself when you’re thinking about the talk idea. The more it can be applicable to the majority of our audience, the better. Future trends, legacy codebases, community challenges and how you’ve solved them, best practices built out of hard-learned lessons–we welcome it all! Do your research. Do your experiments. And write! Finding a buddy or two to help you edit your abstract and eventually your talk, will allow for you to get great feedback and perspective to make your talk even better.</p>

        <h4>What if my talk doesn’t fit the topic suggestions?</h4>
        <p>Cool beans! You don’t have to fit into the confines of our narrow topic offerings to propose a great talk (or performance!). We’d love to read your proposal.</p>

        <h4>When does the CFP Close? Can I get an extension?</h4>
        <p>The CFP closes promptly on June 15 at 11:59pm Eastern Time, unless otherwise announced there will be no extensions. We’ll start notifying speakers accepted June 28. Declines will be sent shortly after.</p>

        <h4>How are submissions selected?</h4>
        <p>Submissions are selected by the caliber of story we think we’ll hear based off of information you’ve given us in your abstract and bio. We also like to balance new and seasoned speakers so that we are injecting new life into the conference speaking circuit by featuring great new people. We prioritize a diverse set of speakers because we expect this from our workplaces, communities, and ecosystem. We work to make sure the perspectives that are important for all of us to grow as kind, welcoming, intentional techies are represented at EmpireJS on stage as speakers, as organizers, and as emcees.</p>
         
        <h4>Why didn’t my talk get selected?</h4>
        <p>This is a very tough question for any conference review group to answer. We see so many stellar talks, and the range of reasons why they aren’t selected can span a very wide range.</p>

        <p>The most common reason is: There isn’t enough space in the schedule, as cliche as that sounds. Every review group for every conference can tell you that every year they have to turn down great talks they wanted to see because there are limited hours in a day. Often we hope we will receive these submissions again in future when have the opportunity to select it again.</p>

        <p>Other common reasons are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Timeliness of the subject: we look for talks that are either timeless or topics that have our attendees have recently been paying more attention to and want to learn more about.
          <li>Other talks are more relevant or focused: we look for talks that aren’t too broad, which is a big concern given our relatively short 30 minute time slot. It is better that our attendees walk away with one or two nuggets of wisdom rather than one or two gigabytes of notes.
          <li>Multiple submissions on the same topic or story: we try not to have multiple talks on the same subject, so when we receive multiple submissions for the same topic it can be hard to stand out. Submissions like this that are selected tend to take a more personal or unique perspective.
